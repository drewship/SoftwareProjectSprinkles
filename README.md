# SoftwareProjectSprinkles

Original project that turned into [EventsApp](https://github.com/afoyer/EventsApp).

## Why?

We thought that creating an iOS app was nice but soon after found about [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) which made us switch to that.

There isn't much to this repository since we were just starting to learn about xCode but I think it is important to keep this repository.
